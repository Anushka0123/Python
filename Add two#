# Python3 program to add two numbers 

  

number1 = input("First number: ") 

number2 = input("\nSecond number: ") 

  
# Adding two numbers 
# User might also enter float numbers 

sum = float(number1) + float(number2) 

  
# Display the sum 
# will print value in float 

print("The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}" .format(number1, number2, sum)) 
Output:

First number: 13.5 Second number: 1.54
The sum of 13.5 and 1.54 is 15.04
